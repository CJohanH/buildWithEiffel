# Eiffel Broadcaster Plugin

This Jenkins plugin sends Eiffel events to a Message Queue. For now, only RabbitMQ is supported.
The plugin can be extended with more events and or more data but the required data is there.
A detailed list of event representations can be found in the table below.

Read more about the Eiffel protocol on https://github.com/eiffel-community/eiffel

## Jenkins events represented in Eiffel are:
| Jenkins Event               | Eiffel Event                 |
| --------------------------- |------------------------------|
| Job Queued                  | EiffelActivityTriggeredEvent |
| Job Dequeued (canceled)     | EiffelActivityCanceledEvent  |
| Job Starts                  | EiffelActivityStartedEvent   |
| Job Finishes                | EiffelActivityFinishedEvent  |
| Job Successful              | EiffelActivityFinishedEvent  |
| Job Unstable                | EiffelActivityFinishedEvent  |
| Job Failed                  | EiffelActivityFinishedEvent  |
| Job Aborted                 | EiffelActivityFinishedEvent  |

### Notes
- Current versions of each event can be found in the getVersion() function in the [sourcecode.](https://github.com/Isacholm/EiffelBroadcaster/tree/master/src/main/java/com/axis/jenkins/plugins/eiffel/eiffelbroadcaster/eiffel)

## Accessing emitted Eiffel events in builds
If a build needs to emit Eiffel events of its own they should probably have
a CONTEXT or CAUSE link to the build's EiffelActivityTriggeredEvent. The
plugins injects the following environment variables with the contents of
the previously sent events:
* `EIFFEL_ACTIVITY_TRIGGERED`: The build's EiffelActivityTriggeredEvent event.
* `EIFFEL_ACTIVITY_STARTED`: The build's EiffelActivityStartedEvent event.

## API
The plugin will do its best to populate the emitted
EiffelActivityTriggeredEvent with information taken from the causes of
the build, but in many cases you'll want to inject additional Eiffel links
that the plugin can't figure out on its own. This can be done with the
$JOB_URL/eiffel/build API endpoint which works nearly identially to the
standard $JOB_URL/build endpoint except that it requires an additional
`eiffellinks` form parameter that contains the Eiffel links to include in
the EiffelActivityTriggeredEvent. `eiffellinks` follows the same schema
as the `links` value in Eiffel events. Example (payload lacking URL
encoding to improve readability):
```
POST $JOB_URL/eiffel/build
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

json={"eiffellinks": [{"target": "662b3813-bef4-4588-bf75-ffaead24a6d5", "type": "CAUSE"}], "parameter": [{"name": "PARAM_NAME", "value": "param value"}]}
```
The `eiffellinks` key is mandatory for this endpoint but `parameter` is
optional. If the latter is omitted and the job is parameterized the default
values for all parameters will be used.

If at least one CAUSE link is included in `eiffellinks`, an `EIFFEL_EVENT`
trigger will be included in the EiffelActivityTriggeredEvent.

## How to build and install this plugin from source
In the EiffelBroadcaster root folder, use maven to compile.
```
$ mvn compile
```
In the EiffelBroadcaster root folder, use maven to build the .hpi file.
```
$ mvn hpi:hpi
```
2. In the Jenkins web interface go to: Manage Jenkins -> Plugin Manager -> Advanced
3. At "Upload Plugin", Browse to the .hpi file located in the EiffelBroadcaster/target directory and press "Upload"

The plugin should install without the need to reboot Jenkins.
