        Sends an
        <a href="https://github.com/eiffel-community/eiffel/blob/master/eiffel-vocabulary/EiffelArtifactPublishedEvent.md">
            EiffelArtifactPublishedEvent
        </a> for each
        <a href="https://github.com/eiffel-community/eiffel/blob/master/eiffel-vocabulary/EiffelArtifactCreatedEvent.md">
            EiffelArtifactCreatedEvent
        </a>
        that has been recorded in the build using a sendEiffelEvent step with
        the <tt>publishArtifact</tt> argument enabled. Optionally also EiffelArtifactCreatedEvent events recorded
        in a file in the workspace.
    </p>
    <p>
        This requires that each EiffelArtifactPublishedEvent has at least one file defined in its
        <tt>data.fileInformation</tt> array and that each relative file path in <tt>data.fileInformation.name</tt>
        matches a Jenkins artifact in the build. Because of the latter requirement it's normally used after an
        <a href="https://www.jenkins.io/doc/pipeline/steps/core/#code-archiveartifacts-code-archive-the-artifacts">
            archiveArtifacts
        </a> step.
    </p>
    <p>
        The EiffelArtifactPublishedEvent will have two links; one ARTIFACT link to the EiffelArtifactCreatedEvent
        and one CONTEXT link to the parent build's EiffelActivityTriggeredEvent.
