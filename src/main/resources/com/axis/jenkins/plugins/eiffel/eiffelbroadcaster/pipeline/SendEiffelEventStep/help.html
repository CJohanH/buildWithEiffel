        Sends an Eiffel event expressed as a Groovy map. This map is passed in the <tt>event</tt> argument.
    </p>
    <p>
        By default the event passed by the user will be decorated with a CONTEXT link to the current build's
        <a href="https://github.com/eiffel-community/eiffel/blob/master/eiffel-vocabulary/EiffelActivityTriggeredEvent.md">
            EiffelActivityTriggeredEvent
        </a>. Optionally a CAUSE link can be created instead or the link can be omitted entirely.
    </p>
    <p>
        This step returns immediately as soon as the event has been validated and put on the internal outbound queue.
        The actual delivery of the event to the broker might not have happened at the time of the return.
