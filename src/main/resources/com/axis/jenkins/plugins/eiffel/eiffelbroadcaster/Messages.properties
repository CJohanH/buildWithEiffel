BuildWithEiffelStep.explicitly_disabling_both_propagate_and_wait=\
    Explicitly disabling both <code>propagate</code> and <code>wait</code> is redundant, since <code>propagate</code> is ignored when <code>wait</code> is disabled. \
    For brevity, leave <code>propagate</code> at its default.
BuildWithEiffelStep.no_wait_for_non_jobs=Waiting for non-job items is not supported
BuildWithEiffelStep.no_job_configured=No job configured
BuildWithEiffelStep.cannot_find=No such job {0}
BuildWithEiffelStep.unsupported=Building a {0} is not supported
BuildWithEiffelStepExecution.building_=Building {0}
BuildWithEiffelStepExecution.convertedParameterDescription=\
    {0} (Automatically converted to {1} because {2} passed the parameter using a different type)
