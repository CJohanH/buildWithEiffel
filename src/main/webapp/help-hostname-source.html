<div>
    Selects how the Jenkins controller's hostname should be determined.
    This hostname will end up in the <tt>meta.source.host</tt> member
    of all emitted events. Two options are available:
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>The hostname of the Jenkins controller according to the network
            stack</b>. The plugin will obtain the hostname from the operating
            system, translate it to an IP address, and resolve it back into
            a (usually fully-qualified) hostname. The result may depend on
            the hosts file and/or DNS.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>The hostname from the configured URL of the Jenkins controller.</b>
            This may be desirable if the Jenkins controller is known by and
            accessed through a DNS alias and it's that alias name rather than
            the physical hostname that should be exposed.
        </li>
    </ul>
